This glossary provides a non-exhaustive list of terms used in the MapillaryJS documentation and codebase.

## Camera Capture

[Still image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image#Still_or_moving) captured by a [camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera). It can be photographs but also frames extracted from a video.

## Image

The main MapillaryJS entity. An image consists of the texture of a [camera capture](/docs/intro/glossary#camera-capture), metadata associated with that camera capture, and artifacts derived from the camera capture itself or the group of adjacent camera captures.

## Street Imagery Map

A map where the primary navigation and point of view are from the street perspective. The map is visualized through street imagery textures and geo-spatial data. MapillaryJS is an example of a street imagery map.
